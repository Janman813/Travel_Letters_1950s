         <p> Still at the Palace Hotel. WEnt to several fu places One
            especially Mrs Dessau told us of. But after we had seen others went
            back to Bangs, which is really the most
            "swell"establishment- and bought the short jacket we liked in the first place. then
            we
            went to Friendrichborg palace,where we went in. A
            huge place with mucH to see. Orders of the White
            Elephant. etc. IN- Took pictures of the storks on the chimney tops. They
            return these nests about May 8th every year. WEnt to a vehyrm charming palace- a resturant where
            we had a view of the castle, looking over a lake. then we proceeded to
            Friedensborg palace, the summer r
            Residence of the King. We were allowed to see just a series of
            rooms on the lower floor. All wrapped up in covers and the curtains all covered up.
            OLD FASHioNeD BUT NICE To elsinore -but did not go
            in.Called KronbergCastle Drive back along the
            coast.Lots of bicycles- many with little children clinging on the back. One little
            boy
            calmly eating a sort of ice cream cone- while his mother rode along with him hanging
            on.
            Again we wandered over to Tivoli and had a simple meal over there. and went to bed
            early
            as we had a days jaunt before us for the next day- to bournhiolm , the danish Island. An air plane to get there!
