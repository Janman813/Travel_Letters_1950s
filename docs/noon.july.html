         Departure. On Queen Elizabeth. At Noon,July 18, 1955.
         
         <p>   We got on board about 10
            Harriet had stayed in Greenwich over night so went in town with us. Wm drove the station wagon with our 
            bags. Very cleverlym selected as we had two suut cases each and a "bottle bag and the typewriter-plus
            a very unhealthy looking green duffle bag(reserved for purchases. THIS folded up on
            thebbottem of a suit case for future use!
            State room gay with flowers and champagne. We had a send of party. Billy was hiding behind a curtain and was a HUGE
            surprise'Caryl had arranged it this way Gail's mother and a friend- Dale and Kissy got to the dock just after 10.30 
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 7c5c7ba1280104f896b2754c1dfa81f90f0c4f14
            and were not allowed to come on board. Too bad.
            Huge ship. Like a section of the Waldorf- the Reacock Alley plus several of the dining rooms- afloat Streams of 
            PEOPLE nulling about.
            
            We had a table in the dining room with 5 other femal ladies. Thought it would divert us. The one man looked us
            over and
            next meal he wasn't there. So we dr4ew ano anoother lady. It all proved to be amusing. We exchange addresses and werephotographed
            to-gether. 
            Voyage very smooth all way over. We took in the movies and pools. I won a few dollars on a pool.
            A Mr and Mrs Andeson, very nice friends of H. and Caryls asked us for cocktails one evening. Then there
            were the parties of the Captain and the Purser Also Esther Boyer was on board with a party of eight in cabin class, she 
            was to steer (ab??) over Europe. She came up and has tea with us one day.
            The Captain and Purser both were on the Franconia about years ago- as under officers- on a world cruise wer were on.
            Both exptremely cordial. 
            Took train around noon for Paris. Hot as blazes. and stuffy besides. Had lunch en route. Quite good.
            Paris and piled our belongings intoo a cab and landed at Le Br istol- a rather smallish hotel were diplomats go- white marble 
            and mirrors. We had an oval white panelled round sitting room. (which we didn't need
            and later gave up.)
            Very weary and after some refreshing tub baths went over to the Crenailliere(nearby) where we had a very delicious dinner.</p>
