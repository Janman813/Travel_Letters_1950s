               take off for <span class="place">Copenhagen</span> and are sit-ting around so I will try to send this second
               intallement of our trip report. If I remember correctly, the last letter came from
               the 
               <div class="transport">boat</div>.
               We arrived in <span class="place">Cherbourg</span> and got safely on the 
               <div class="transport">train</div> to find that it was over 90. We nearly
               died on the ride to <span class="place">Paris</span>. Very unairconditioned 
               <div class="transport">train</div> and blazing sun. The first thing we
               did when we arrived at <span class="place">Le Bristol</span> was fall in a cold tub. WE went out for 
               <div class="meal">dinner</div> later and
               cele-brated with Cherrie Jubilee. Very Tasty! The next day 
               <div class="person"><b><i>Mrs. Behrend</i></b></div> hired a car and
               guide and we drove all over <span class="place">Paris</span>. It is so beautiful but so expensive? $90 a minute to
               breath! We did a bit of shopping, had 
               <div class="meal">lunch</div> in the <span class="place">Bois de Boulougne</span> shopped on the <span class="place">Left
                  Bank</span>, got 
               <div class="transport">train</div> 
               <div class="item">tickets</div> and that night went to the <span class="place">Casino de Paris</span>. Pretty naked ladies I
               must say. We were not carried away by it but see it, so that is that. The next morning
               we
               were up at the crack of dawn and off to Tours. the man and his wife who ran the <span class="place">Manior
                  Bercheron</span>, where we stayed as a member of the family were terribly nice. We arrived in time
               for 
               <div class="meal">lunch</div> and got in a little 
               <div class="transport">car</div> and went through some beautiful country to see some of the
               <span class="place">chateaux</span>. We enjoyed it tremendously. You can see where all the old French painters got all
               their inspirations. Lovely rivers, old mills and beautiful trees. That night after
               
               <div class="meal">dinner</div> we
               went to a nearby <span class="place">chateau</span>, <span class="place">Azay-le-Rideau</span> which was illuminated. Just like <span class="place">fairyland</span>. They
               also had a sort of play very cleverly done just done with voices and lighting which
               told the
               history of the <span class="place">building</span>. We will never forget it. Thursday, the 
               <div class="person"><b><i>Davidsons</i></b></div>, our hosts and
               their little boy and ourselves went on another <span class="place">chateaux</span> trip which was just a grand as the
               day before. We had a picnic on the way and tea on the way home. Great fun. The only
               thing
               that marred the trip was another guest who arrived who knew all about everything and
               told it
               in the loudest of voices. I got in a ter-rible row with him about sports. Everyone
               was on my
               side but you couldn't get a word in edge wise. It was was rather funny to look back
               on but I
               nearly had a nervous breakdown when it was going on. Friday we left Tours at about
               eleven
               and got back in <span class="place">Paris</span> for 
               <div class="meal">lunch</div>. After the lovely meal we charged out on foot to do some
               shopping. </p>

               <div class="Period">12th Century</div> chapel, or on the banks of the
               Loire across from <span class="place">Mme. de Pompadour's palace at Ménars</span>. We will also take you to one of the outstanding restaurants of Tours 
               on a picturesque medieval square.
               We are looking forward with pleasure to meeting you, with or without your children.

                  which told the history of the building. We will never forget it.</p>
