                Place de Vandome to Caron, The Ritz Hotel, and a jewellers where I was intregued by a 
                Jewelled bird. But did NOT get it! To a very nice resturant in the Bois for lunch Le Pre

                station and Tourist Agencyreg. tickets. We had our evening meal at the Bristol and then
                set out for the Casion deParis. Very amusing show- we stayed thro' <u>half</u> of it but felt we

            <p style="font-size:15px"><b>THIRD IMAGE TRANSCRIPT:</b> "July 26, 1955 Brussles - Dear People:
                We are just about to take off for Copenhagen and are sit-ting around so I will try to send
                this second intallement of our trip report. If I remember correctly, the last letter came
                from the boat. We arrived in Cherbourg and got safely on the train to find that it was over
                90. We nearly died on the ride to Paris. Very unairconditioned train and blazing sun. The first
                thing we did when we arrived at Le Bristol was fall in a cold tub. WE went out for dinner later
                and cele-brated with Cherrie Jubilee. Very Tasty! The next day Mrs. Behrend hired a car and guide
                and we drove all over Paris. It is so beautiful but so expensive? $90 a minute to breath! We did
                a bit of shopping, had lunch in the Bois de Boulougne shopped on the Left Bank, got train tickets
                and that night went to the Casino de Paris. Pretty naked ladies I must say. We were not carried away
                by it but see it, so that is that. The next morning we were up at the crack of dawn and off to Tours.
                the man and his wife who ran the Manior Bercheron, where we stayed as a member of the family were
                terribly nice. We arrived in time for lunch and got in a little car and went through some beautiful
                country to see some of the chateaux. We enjoyed it tremendously. You can see where all the old French
                painters got all their inspirations. Lovely rivers, old mills and beautiful trees. That night after
                dinner we went to a nearby chateau, Azay-le-Rideau which was illuminated. Just like fairyland. They 
                also had a sort of play very cleverly done just done with voices and lighting which told the history
                of the building. We will never forget it. Thursday, the Davidsons, our hosts and their little boy and
                ourselves went on another chateaux trip which was just a grand as the day before. We had a picnic on
                the way and tea on the way home. Great fun. The only thing that marred the trip was another guest who
                arrived who knew all about everything and told it in the loudest of voices. I got in a ter-rible row
                with him about sports. Everyone was on my side but you couldn't get a word in edge wise. It was was
                rather funny to look back on but I nearly had a nervous breakdown when it was going on. Friday we left
                Tours at about eleven and got back in Paris for lunch. After the lovely meal we charged out on foot to
                do some shopping.
