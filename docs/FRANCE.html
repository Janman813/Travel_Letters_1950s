            <p>Took a motor from travel agency-after 
               <div class="meal">breakfast</div> in our fancy round sitting room. Drove all around <span class="place">Paris</span> the driver named Harvey had a daughter named at <span class="place">Waycross Georgia</span>. Went to
               <span class="place">Lubin's</span> for perfrume (had the pink flannel affair that Harriet had given me- REsented') Walked around the circle- <span class="place">Place de Vandome</span> to
               <span class="place">Caron</span>, <span class="place">The Ritz Hotel</span>, and a <span class="place">jewellers</span>
               where I was intregued by a Jewelled bird. But did NOT get it! To a very nice resturant in
               the <span class="place">Bois</span> for 
               <div class="meal">lunch</div> <span class="place">Le Pre Catalan</span>. Went then to both sides of the <span class="place">Sien</span> and got some little
               prints of <span class="place">Paris</span>. <span class="place">R.R. station</span> and <span class="place">Tourist Agency|reg</span>. tickets. We had our evening meal at the
               <span class="place">Bristol</span> and then set out for the <span class="place">Casion deParis</span>. Very amusing show- we stayed thro'
               half of it but felt we needed sleep. Gail got a cab by her shrill
               whistle!"</p>

            <p>  <span class="place">Brussles</span> - Dear People: We are just about to
               take off for <span class="place">Copenhagen</span> and are sit-ting around so I will try to send this second
               intallement of our trip report. If I remember correctly, the last letter came from
               the boat.
               We arrived in <span class="place">Cherbourg</span> and got safely on the train to find that it was over 90. We nearly
               died on the ride to <span class="place">Paris</span>. Very unairconditioned train and blazing sun. The first thing we
               did when we arrived at <span class="place">Le Bristol</span> was fall in a cold tub. WE went out for 
               <div class="meal">dinner</div> later and
               cele-brated with Cherrie Jubilee. Very Tasty! The next day Mrs. Behrend hired a car and
               guide and we drove all over <span class="place">Paris</span>. It is so beautiful but so expensive? $90 a minute to
               breath! We did a bit of shopping, had 
               <div class="meal">lunch</div> in the <span class="place">Bois de Boulougne</span> shopped on the <span class="place">Left
                  Bank</span>, got train tickets and that night went to the <span class="place">Casino de Paris</span>. Pretty naked ladies I
               must say. We were not carried away by it but see it, so that is that. The next morning
               we
               were up at the crack of dawn and off to Tours. the man and his wife who ran the <span class="place">Manior
                  Bercheron</span>, where we stayed as a member of the family were terribly nice. We arrived in time
               for 
               <div class="meal">lunch</div> and got in a little car and went through some beautiful country to see some of the
               <span class="place">chateaux</span>. We enjoyed it tremendously. You can see where all the old French painters got all
               their inspirations. Lovely rivers, old mills and beautiful trees. That night after
               
               <div class="meal">dinner</div> we
               went to a nearby <span class="place">chateau</span>, <span class="place">Azay-le-Rideau</span> which was illuminated. Just like <span class="place">fairyland</span>. They
               also had a sort of play very cleverly done just done with voices and lighting which
               told the
               history of the <span class="place">building</span>. We will never forget it. Thursday, the Davidsons, our hosts and
               their little boy and ourselves went on another <span class="place">chateaux</span> trip which was just a grand as the
               day before. We had a picnic on the way and tea on the way home. Great fun. The only
               thing
               that marred the trip was another guest who arrived who knew all about everything and
               told it
               in the loudest of voices. I got in a ter-rible row with him about sports. Everyone
               was on my
               side but you couldn't get a word in edge wise. It was was rather funny to look back
               on but I
               nearly had a nervous breakdown when it was going on. Friday we left Tours at about
               eleven
               and got back in <span class="place">Paris</span> for 
               <div class="meal">lunch</div>. After the lovely meal we charged out on foot to do some
               shopping. </p>

               fur jackets.And then to jensens where Gail made a purchase. To
               Weacvers embroidery shop. Then to <span class="place">Oscar Davidson's</span> where the
               Menu is several yards long- allopen faced
               
               <div class="meal">sadnwhiches</div>. Didn't think so much ofthis place. Then to the
               <span class="place">Permente</span> again and then back to the astoria to pack up our
               things and left for the <span class="place">Palace Hotel</span> where
               we had a rather nice room etc. Then we rushed out to the <span class="place">Rosenborg
                  Palace</span> to see the jewels etc. It was close in about half an hour so
               didn't have too much time.After this we drove out to the <span class="place">Royal
                  Deer Park</span>. A large building in a park- open fields with many
               herds of deer roaming about </p>
            
            <p> In the evening we were invited to Mr Dessau's f or
               dinner. his son William came in to get us. Very nice and
               friendly. Almost everyone seems to speak English. They get a terrific lot of it in
               the schools. Mrs Dessau looks very young Had another son
               there-ROul- and his very sweet bride of a few months. She
               was born in <span class="place">Mexico</span> and in fact IS
               Mexican but lived a long time in
               <span class="place">Texas</span>. Does notnSpeak Danish. After
               meeting them all Mr Dessau Asked us to see his
               <span class="place">garden</span>. He had several hundred
               parakets in a huge cage- like a big
               room- and arranged so they could fly in and out. Then he
               showed us his special pets Two tame Kangaroo!! They hoppedout of
               their enclosure and like to me patted. Very tam. He has had them several years. T
               gave Mrs Dessau one of my little trimmed
               Christmas trees And to the bride a little "shelf" which was
               really Mexican and I had trimmed it over and remade it
               They werre very pleqsed. had a nice evening and enjoyed
               them all. Also we LIKE the Toborg beer better than ant other kind!! </p>

            <p> Still at the <span class="place">Palace Hotel</span>. WEnt to several fu places One
               especially Mrs Dessau told us of. But after we had seen others went
               back to <span class="place">Bangs</span>, which is really the most
               "swell"establishment- and bought the short jacket we liked in the first place. then
               we
               went to <span class="place">Friendrichborg palace</span>,where we went in. A
               huge place with mucH to see. Orders of the White
               Elephant. etc. IN- Took pictures of the storks on the chimney tops. They
               return these nests about <span class="date">May 8th</span> every year. WEnt to a vehyrm charming palace- a resturant where
               we had a view of the castle, looking over a lake. then we proceeded to
               <span class="place">Friedensborg palace</span>, the summer r
               Residence of the King. We were allowed to see just a series of
               rooms on the lower floor. All wrapped up in covers and the curtains all covered up.
               OLD FASHioNeD BUT NICE To elsinore -but did not go
               in.Called <span class="place">KronbergCastle</span> Drive back along the
               coast.Lots of bicycles- many with little children clinging on the back. One little
               boy
               calmly eating a sort of ice cream cone- while his mother rode along with him hanging
               on.
               Again we wandered over to Tivoli and had a simple meal over there. and went to bed
               early
               as we had a days jaunt before us for the next day- to bournhiolm , the danish Island. An air plane to get there!

            <p>
               <span class="place">The Manoir de Bécheron</span> is a private home which welcomes a few paying guests. It is a rambling 15th-16th Century house 
               situated in the peaceful valley of the<span class="place"> Indre</span> in the heart of the <span class="place">Chateaux de la Loire region</span>. The air of Old World charm
               with modern comfort. The cuisine is French, meals are 'en famille', except for breakfast,
               which is served in your room 
               or if you choose, in the gardens.
               You are one of us when we go visiting our French and American neighbors. Among them
               are such famous artists as Alexander 
               Calder, Max Ernst and A. Ozenfant.
               Bécheron is 25 kilometers from Tours, which can be reached by rail from <span class="place">Paris</span> in about two and half hours. Of course we
               meet you at the station.
               The rate in high-season <span class="date">(June 15</span>-<span class="date">August 31</span>) is $15 a day or $100 a week per person all inclusive (room, bath, 3 meals, 
               wines, liqueurs, coffee and service). This includes the local excursions around <span class="place">Bécheron</span> such as <span class="place">Saché,</span> <span class="place">Azay-le-Rideau,</span>
               Tours, <span class="place">Langeais.</span> <span class="place">The Saché Museum </span>now houses a permanent exhibit of the sculpture of my father, Jo Davidson. The off-season
               rate <span class="date">(March 1</span>-<span class="date">June 14</span>; <span class="date">Sept. 1</span>-<span class="date">October 31)</span> is $10 a day or $65 a week per person. Contrary to the usual continental practice
               there are no extra charges at Bécheron.
               My French wife and I have two children, Eva age 12 and Laurent who is 5; we can and do care for children, and you will find 
               they are never underfoot. If you should want a place where you can safetly leave yours
               while touring <span class="place">Europe, Bécheron</span> is 
               the place you are looking for. Our children were born in the <span class="place">United States</span> and speak French and English as of course we do.
               A week in <span class="place">Bécheron</span> is over before you realize it! You won't want to miss the thrilling sight of the
               illuminated chateaux;
               they alone are worth the trip. The <span class="place">"Sleeping Beauty" castle of Usse</span>, <span class="place">Azay-le-Rideau</span>, famous Chenonceau and Chambord are but 
               a few of the fabulous palaces which surround us.
               During one of your outings we will picnic in the <span class="place">Forêt de Loches</span> near a circular 12th Century chapel, or on the banks of the
               Loire across from <span class="place">Mme. de Pompadour's palace at Ménars</span>. We will also take you to one of the outstanding restaurants of Tours 
               on a picturesque medieval square.
               We are looking forward with pleasure to meeting you, with or without your children.
               We'll be glad to answer any specific questions
               you may have. 
               Write for us.</p>

               Harriet had stayed in <span class="place">Greenwich</span> over night so went in town with us. Wm drove the station wagon with our 
               bags. Very cleverlym selected as we had two suut cases each and a "bottle bag and the typewriter-plus
               a very unhealthy looking green duffle bag(reserved for purchases. THIS folded up on
               thebbottem of a suit case for future use!
               State room gay with flowers and champagne. We had a send of party. Billy was hiding behind a curtain and was a HUGE

               and were not allowed to come on board. Too bad.
               Huge ship. Like a section of the <span class="place">Waldorf- the Reacock Alley</span> plus several of the <span class="place">dining</span> rooms- afloat Streams of 
               PEOPLE nulling about.
               
               We had a table in the <span class="place">dining</span> room with 5 other femal ladies. Thought it would divert us. The one man looked us
               over and
               next meal he wasn't there. So we dr4ew ano anoother lady. It all proved to be amusing. We exchange addresses and werephotographed
               to-gether. 
               Voyage very smooth all way over. We took in the <span class="place">movies</span> and <span class="place">pools</span>. I won a few dollars on a pool.
               A Mr and Mrs Andeson, very nice friends of H. and Caryls asked us for cocktails one evening. Then there
               were the parties of the Captain and the Purser Also Esther Boyer was on board with a party of eight in cabin class, she 
               was to steer (ab??) over <span class="place">Europe</span>. She came up and has tea with us one day.
               The Captain and Purser both were on the <span class="place">Franconia</span> about years ago- as under officers- on a world cruise wer were on.
               Both exptremely cordial. 
               Took train around noon for <span class="place">Paris</span>. Hot as blazes. and stuffy besides. Had

               <span class="place">Paris</span> and piled our belongings intoo a cab and landed at <span class="place">Le Br istol</span>- a rather smallish hotel were diplomats go- white marble

               and later gave up.)
               Very weary and after some refreshing tub baths went over to the <span class="place">Crenailliere</span>(nearby) where we had a very delicious

            Dear Peoples
            
            <p>We are just about to take off for <span class="place">Copenhagen</span> and are sit- ting
               around so I will try to send this second installment of our trip report. If I
               remember correctly, the last letter came from the boat. We arrived in
               <span class="place">Cherbourg</span> and got safely on the train to
               fin that it was over 90. We nearly died on the ride to <span class="place">Paris</span>. Very
               unairconditioned train and blazing sun. The first thing we did when we arrived at
               <span class="place">Le Bristol</span> was fall in cold tub. We went out for
               
               <div class="meal">dinner</div> later and cele- brater with Charles
               Jubilee. Very tasty! The next day Mrs. Behrend hired a
               car and guide and we drove all over <span class="place">Paris</span>.
               It is so beautiful but so expensive!
               $90 a minute to breath! We did a bit of shopping, had lunch in the
               <span class="place">Bois de Boulougne</span> shopped on the Left Bank, got
               train tickets and that night went to the <span class="place">Casino de
                  Paris</span>. Pretty naked ladies I must say. We were not carried away by it
               but did see it, so that is that.</p>
            
            <p>The next morning we were up at the crack of dawn and off to Tours. The man and
               his wife who ran the <span class="place">Manior Berheron</span>, where we stayed as a
               mm-ber of the family were terribly nice. We
               arravied in time for 
               <div class="meal">lunch</div> and then got in a little car and went
               through some beautiful country to see some of the chateaux. We enjoyed it
               traemndously. You can see where the old French painters get all their inspirations.
               Lovely rivers, old mills and beautiful trees. That night after 
               <div class="meal">dinner</div> we
               went to a nearby chateau, Azay-le-Rideau which was illuminated. Just like fairyland.
               They also had a sort of play very cleverly done just done with voices and lighting
               which told the history of the building. We will never forget it.</p>
            
            <p>Thursday, the Davidsons, our hosts and their little boy and and
               ourselves went on another chateaux trip which was just a grand as the day before.
               We
               had a 
               <div class="meal">picnic</div> on the way and day on the way home. Great
               fun. The only thing that marred the trip was another guest who arrived who knew all
               about everything and told it in the loudest of voices. I got in a ter- rible row
               with him about sports. Everyone was on my side but you couldn't get a word in edge
               wise. Itwas rather funny to look back on but I nearly had a nervous breakdown when
               it was going on.</p>
            
            
            <p>
               Friday we left Tours at about eleven and got back in Paris for
               
               <div class="meal">lunch</div>. After the lovely meal we changed out on foot to do some
               shopping.</p>
            
            
            
            <p>and walked around. This we dis. Not too many purchases. We were going upto
               <span class="place">montmartre</span> but decided to get to bed early to leave for
               <span class="place">Brussels</span> the next day.</p>
            
            <p>We had a perfect flight from <span class="place">London</span> here. Mercedes Bucher met us
               at the airport and we came to the hotel. the Wilsons, Mrs. BBs cousin, called and
               came over for a drink. We then went for a delicious 
               <div class="meal">lunch</div>, food is
               marvelous here, on the <span class="place">Grand Place</span> which is fantatic. Mercedes has a
               car so we spent the afternoon seeing
               <span class="place">Brussels</span> which is very pretty. Lovely park and old buildings. Had
               
               <div class="meal">dinner</div> in a very old place with lots of atmoshpere and good food.
               Sunday we piled into the car and went to
               <span class="place">Burges</span>, about and hour and a half away. A divine old town. We
               took a ride in a carriage all over the town. Great fun. On
               the way back we stopped for tea in the <span class="place">Osten</span> which is
               a big seaside resort. Arrived back here at eight and ha a light 
               <div class="meal">supper</div>
               on the <span class="place">Grand Place</span> which is illuminated at night and breathtaking.
               Yesterday we shopped most of the day and walked around seeing things. All had
               cocktails at the <span class="place">Wilsons hotel</span> and dinner
               later.</p>
            
            <p> It is now Tuesday again and we leave here at 12:55 for
               <span class="place">Copen- hagen</span> arriving there at 4:30. Have to change
               planes in <span class="place">Amsterdam</span>. Mer- bill etc. The Wilsons left
               a while ago for <span class="place">Paris</span>. We will see them in <span class="place">London</span> in
               August.</p>
            
            <p>We see by the paper that it is still unberable in <span class="place">New York</span> and
               are pleased to be here. weather has been perfect except for the day we arrived.</p>
            
            
             Much love to all from both of us.
