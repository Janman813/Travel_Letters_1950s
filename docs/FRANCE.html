         <p>Took a motor from travel agency-after breakfast in our fancy round sitting room. Drove all around Paris the driver named Harvey had a daughter named at Waycross Georgia. Went to
            Lubin's for perfrume (had the pink flannel affair that Harriet had given me- REsented') Walked around the circle- Place de Vandome to
            Caron, The Ritz Hotel, and a jewellers
            where I was intregued by a Jewelled bird. But did NOT get it! To a very nice resturant in
            the Bois for lunch Le Pre Catalan. Went then to both sides of the Sien and got some little
            prints of Paris. R.R. station and Tourist Agency|reg. tickets. We had our evening meal at the
            Bristol and then set out for the Casion deParis. Very amusing show- we stayed thro'
            half of it but felt we needed sleep. Gail got a cab by her shrill
            whistle!"</p>

         <p> July 26, 1955 Brussles - Dear People: We are just about to
            take off for Copenhagen and are sit-ting around so I will try to send this second
            intallement of our trip report. If I remember correctly, the last letter came from
            the boat.
            We arrived in Cherbourg and got safely on the train to find that it was over 90. We nearly
            died on the ride to Paris. Very unairconditioned train and blazing sun. The first thing we
            did when we arrived at Le Bristol was fall in a cold tub. WE went out for dinner later and
            cele-brated with Cherrie Jubilee. Very Tasty! The next day Mrs. Behrend hired a car and
            guide and we drove all over Paris. It is so beautiful but so expensive? $90 a minute to
            breath! We did a bit of shopping, had lunch in the Bois de Boulougne shopped on the Left
            Bank, got train tickets and that night went to the Casino de Paris. Pretty naked ladies I
            must say. We were not carried away by it but see it, so that is that. The next morning
            we
            were up at the crack of dawn and off to Tours. the man and his wife who ran the Manior
            Bercheron, where we stayed as a member of the family were terribly nice. We arrived in time
            for lunch and got in a little car and went through some beautiful country to see some of the
            chateaux. We enjoyed it tremendously. You can see where all the old French painters got all
            their inspirations. Lovely rivers, old mills and beautiful trees. That night after
            dinner we
            went to a nearby chateau, Azay-le-Rideau which was illuminated. Just like fairyland. They
            also had a sort of play very cleverly done just done with voices and lighting which
            told the
            history of the building. We will never forget it. Thursday, the Davidsons, our hosts and
            their little boy and ourselves went on another chateaux trip which was just a grand as the
            day before. We had a picnic on the way and tea on the way home. Great fun. The only
            thing
            that marred the trip was another guest who arrived who knew all about everything and
            told it
            in the loudest of voices. I got in a ter-rible row with him about sports. Everyone
            was on my
            side but you couldn't get a word in edge wise. It was was rather funny to look back
            on but I
            nearly had a nervous breakdown when it was going on. Friday we left Tours at about
            eleven
            and got back in Paris for lunch. After the lovely meal we charged out on foot to do some
            shopping. </p>
