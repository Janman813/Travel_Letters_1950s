         Departure. On Queen Elizabeth. At Noon,July 18, 1955.
         
         <p>   We got on board about 10
            Harriet had stayed in Greenwich over night so went in town with us. Wm drove the station wagon with our 
            bags. Very cleverlym selected as we had two suut cases each and a "bottle bag and the typewriter-plus
            a very unhealthy looking green duffle bag(reserved for purchases. THIS folded up on
            thebbottem of a suit case for future use!
            State room gay with flowers and champagne. We had a send of party. Billy was hiding behind a curtain and was a HUGE
            surprise'Caryl had arranged it this way Gail's mother and a friend- Dale and Kissy got to the dock just after 10.30

            and were not allowed to come on board. Too bad.
            Huge ship. Like a section of the Waldorf- the Reacock Alley plus several of the dining rooms- afloat Streams of 
            PEOPLE nulling about.
            
            We had a table in the dining room with 5 other femal ladies. Thought it would divert us. The one man looked us
            over and
            next meal he wasn't there. So we dr4ew ano anoother lady. It all proved to be amusing. We exchange addresses and werephotographed
            to-gether. 
            Voyage very smooth all way over. We took in the movies and pools. I won a few dollars on a pool.
            A Mr and Mrs Andeson, very nice friends of H. and Caryls asked us for cocktails one evening. Then there
            were the parties of the Captain and the Purser Also Esther Boyer was on board with a party of eight in cabin class, she 
            was to steer (ab??) over Europe. She came up and has tea with us one day.
            The Captain and Purser both were on the Franconia about years ago- as under officers- on a world cruise wer were on.
            Both exptremely cordial. 
            Took train around noon for Paris. Hot as blazes. and stuffy besides. Had lunch en route. Quite good.
            Paris and piled our belongings intoo a cab and landed at Le Br istol- a rather smallish hotel were diplomats go- white marble 
            and mirrors. We had an oval white panelled round sitting room. (which we didn't need
            and later gave up.)
            Very weary and after some refreshing tub baths went over to the Crenailliere(nearby) where we had a very delicious dinner.</p>

         July 19th. 1955
         
         
         
         <p>Took a motor from travel agency-after breakfast in our fancy round sitting room. Drove all around Paris the driver named Harvey had a daughter named at Waycross Georgia. Went to
            Lubin's for perfrume (had the pink flannel affair that Harriet had given me- REsented') Walked around the circle- Place de Vandome to
            Caron, The Ritz Hotel, and a jewellers
            where I was intregued by a Jewelled bird. But did NOT get it! To a very nice resturant in
            the Bois for lunch Le Pre Catalan. Went then to both sides of the Sien and got some little
            prints of Paris. R.R. station and Tourist Agency|reg. tickets. We had our evening meal at the
            Bristol and then set out for the Casion deParis. Very amusing show- we stayed thro'
            half of it but felt we needed sleep. Gail got a cab by her shrill
            whistle!"</p>

         <p> July 26, 1955 Brussles - Dear People: We are just about to
            take off for Copenhagen and are sit-ting around so I will try to send this second
            intallement of our trip report. If I remember correctly, the last letter came from
            the boat.
            We arrived in Cherbourg and got safely on the train to find that it was over 90. We nearly
            died on the ride to Paris. Very unairconditioned train and blazing sun. The first thing we
            did when we arrived at Le Bristol was fall in a cold tub. WE went out for dinner later and
            cele-brated with Cherrie Jubilee. Very Tasty! The next day Mrs. Behrend hired a car and
            guide and we drove all over Paris. It is so beautiful but so expensive? $90 a minute to
            breath! We did a bit of shopping, had lunch in the Bois de Boulougne shopped on the Left
            Bank, got train tickets and that night went to the Casino de Paris. Pretty naked ladies I
            must say. We were not carried away by it but see it, so that is that. The next morning
            we
            were up at the crack of dawn and off to Tours. the man and his wife who ran the Manior
            Bercheron, where we stayed as a member of the family were terribly nice. We arrived in time
            for lunch and got in a little car and went through some beautiful country to see some of the
            chateaux. We enjoyed it tremendously. You can see where all the old French painters got all
            their inspirations. Lovely rivers, old mills and beautiful trees. That night after
            dinner we
            went to a nearby chateau, Azay-le-Rideau which was illuminated. Just like fairyland. They
            also had a sort of play very cleverly done just done with voices and lighting which
            told the
            history of the building. We will never forget it. Thursday, the Davidsons, our hosts and
            their little boy and ourselves went on another chateaux trip which was just a grand as the
            day before. We had a picnic on the way and tea on the way home. Great fun. The only
            thing
            that marred the trip was another guest who arrived who knew all about everything and
            told it
            in the loudest of voices. I got in a ter-rible row with him about sports. Everyone
            was on my
            side but you couldn't get a word in edge wise. It was was rather funny to look back
            on but I
            nearly had a nervous breakdown when it was going on. Friday we left Tours at about
            eleven
            and got back in Paris for lunch. After the lovely meal we charged out on foot to do some
            shopping. </p>

         <p> Did letter and left the Astoria with Otto and the ford
            car- our new car and driver for our jaunt.Went to Bang andlooked at
            fur jackets.And then to jensens where Gail made a purchase. To
            Weacvers embroidery shop. Then to Oscar Davidson's where the
            Menu is several yards long- allopen faced
            sadnwhiches. Didn't think so much ofthis place. Then to the
            Permente again and then back to the astoria to pack up our
            things and left for the Palace Hotel where
            we had a rather nice room etc. Then we rushed out to the Rosenborg
            Palace to see the jewels etc. It was close in about half an hour so
            didn't have too much time.After this we drove out to the Royal
            Deer Park. A large building in a park- open fields with many
            herds of deer roaming about </p>
         
         <p> In the evening we were invited to Mr Dessau's f or
            dinner. his son William came in to get us. Very nice and
            friendly. Almost everyone seems to speak English. They get a terrific lot of it in
            the schools. Mrs Dessau looks very young Had another son
            there-ROul- and his very sweet bride of a few months. She
            was born in Mexico and in fact IS
            Mexican but lived a long time in
            Texas. Does notnSpeak Danish. After
            meeting them all Mr Dessau Asked us to see his
            garden. He had several hundred
            parakets in a huge cage- like a big
            room- and arranged so they could fly in and out. Then he
            showed us his special pets Two tame Kangaroo!! They hoppedout of
            their enclosure and like to me patted. Very tam. He has had them several years. T
            gave Mrs Dessau one of my little trimmed
            Christmas trees And to the bride a little "shelf" which was
            really Mexican and I had trimmed it over and remade it
            They werre very pleqsed. had a nice evening and enjoyed
            them all. Also we LIKE the Toborg beer better than ant other kind!! </p>

         <p> Still at the Palace Hotel. WEnt to several fu places One
            especially Mrs Dessau told us of. But after we had seen others went
            back to Bangs, which is really the most
            "swell"establishment- and bought the short jacket we liked in the first place. then
            we
            went to Friendrichborg palace,where we went in. A
            huge place with mucH to see. Orders of the White
            Elephant. etc. IN- Took pictures of the storks on the chimney tops. They
            return these nests about May 8th every year. WEnt to a vehyrm charming palace- a resturant where
            we had a view of the castle, looking over a lake. then we proceeded to
            Friedensborg palace, the summer r
            Residence of the King. We were allowed to see just a series of
            rooms on the lower floor. All wrapped up in covers and the curtains all covered up.
            OLD FASHioNeD BUT NICE To elsinore -but did not go
            in.Called KronbergCastle Drive back along the
            coast.Lots of bicycles- many with little children clinging on the back. One little
            boy
            calmly eating a sort of ice cream cone- while his mother rode along with him hanging
            on.
            Again we wandered over to Tivoli and had a simple meal over there. and went to bed
            early
            as we had a days jaunt before us for the next day- to bournhiolm , the danish Island. An air plane to get there!

            The Manoir de Bécheron is a private home which welcomes a few paying guests. It is a rambling 15th-16th Century house 
            situated in the peaceful valley of the Indre in the heart of the Chateaux de la Loire region. The air of Old World charm
            with modern comfort. The cuisine is French, meals are 'en famille', except for breakfast,
            which is served in your room 
            or if you choose, in the gardens.
            You are one of us when we go visiting our French and American neighbors. Among them
            are such famous artists as Alexander 
            Calder, Max Ernst and A. Ozenfant.
            Bécheron is 25 kilometers from Tours, which can be reached by rail from Paris in about two and half hours. Of course we
            meet you at the station.
            The rate in high-season (June 15-August 31) is $15 a day or $100 a week per person all inclusive (room, bath, 3 meals, 
            wines, liqueurs, coffee and service). This includes the local excursions around Bécheron such as Saché, Azay-le-Rideau,
            Tours, Langeais. The Saché Museum now houses a permanent exhibit of the sculpture of my father, Jo Davidson. The off-season
            rate (March 1-June 14; Sept. 1-October 31) is $10 a day or $65 a week per person. Contrary to the usual continental practice
            there are no extra charges at Bécheron.
            My French wife and I have two children, Eva age 12 and Laurent who is 5; we can and do care for children, and you will find 
            they are never underfoot. If you should want a place where you can safetly leave yours
            while touring Europe, Bécheron is 
            the place you are looking for. Our children were born in the United States and speak French and English as of course we do.
            A week in Bécheron is over before you realize it! You won't want to miss the thrilling sight of the
            illuminated chateaux;
            they alone are worth the trip. The "Sleeping Beauty" castle of Usse, Azay-le-Rideau, famous Chenonceau and Chambord are but 
            a few of the fabulous palaces which surround us.
            During one of your outings we will picnic in the Forêt de Loches near a circular 12th Century chapel, or on the banks of the
            Loire across from Mme. de Pompadour's palace at Ménars. We will also take you to one of the outstanding restaurants of Tours 
            on a picturesque medieval square.
            We are looking forward with pleasure to meeting you, with or without your children.
            We'll be glad to answer any specific questions
            you may have. 
            Write for us.</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p> Cordially yours, 
            (signiture)
