         <p> Did letter and left the Astoria with Otto and the ford
            car- our new car and driver for our jaunt.Went to Bang andlooked at
            fur jackets.And then to jensens where Gail made a purchase. To
            Weacvers embroidery shop. Then to Oscar Davidson's where the
            Menu is several yards long- allopen faced
            sadnwhiches. Didn't think so much ofthis place. Then to the
            Permente again and then back to the astoria to pack up our
            things and left for the Palace Hotel where
            we had a rather nice room etc. Then we rushed out to the Rosenborg
            Palace to see the jewels etc. It was close in about half an hour so
            didn't have too much time.After this we drove out to the Royal
            Deer Park. A large building in a park- open fields with many
            herds of deer roaming about </p>
         
         <p> In the evening we were invited to Mr Dessau's f or
            dinner. his son William came in to get us. Very nice and
            friendly. Almost everyone seems to speak English. They get a terrific lot of it in
            the schools. Mrs Dessau looks very young Had another son
            there-ROul- and his very sweet bride of a few months. She
            was born in Mexico and in fact IS
            Mexican but lived a long time in
            Texas. Does notnSpeak Danish. After
            meeting them all Mr Dessau Asked us to see his
            garden. He had several hundred
            parakets in a huge cage- like a big
            room- and arranged so they could fly in and out. Then he
            showed us his special pets Two tame Kangaroo!! They hoppedout of
            their enclosure and like to me patted. Very tam. He has had them several years. T
            gave Mrs Dessau one of my little trimmed
            Christmas trees And to the bride a little "shelf" which was
            really Mexican and I had trimmed it over and remade it
            They werre very pleqsed. had a nice evening and enjoyed
            them all. Also we LIKE the Toborg beer better than ant other kind!! </p>
