    <p><!-- THIRD IMAGE TRANSCRIPT: --> July 26, 1955 Brussles - Dear People: We are just about to
        take off for Copenhagen and are sit-ting around so I will try to send this second
        intallement of our trip report. If I remember correctly, the last letter came from the boat.
        We arrived in Cherbourg and got safely on the train to find that it was over 90. We nearly
        died on the ride to Paris. Very unairconditioned train and blazing sun. The first thing we
        did when we arrived at Le Bristol was fall in a cold tub. WE went out for dinner later and
        cele-brated with Cherrie Jubilee. Very Tasty! The next day Mrs. Behrend hired a car and
        guide and we drove all over Paris. It is so beautiful but so expensive? $90 a minute to
        breath! We did a bit of shopping, had lunch in the Bois de Boulougne shopped on the Left
        Bank, got train tickets and that night went to the Casino de Paris. Pretty naked ladies I
        must say. We were not carried away by it but see it, so that is that. The next morning we
        were up at the crack of dawn and off to Tours. the man and his wife who ran the Manior
        Bercheron, where we stayed as a member of the family were terribly nice. We arrived in time
        for lunch and got in a little car and went through some beautiful country to see some of the
        chateaux. We enjoyed it tremendously. You can see where all the old French painters got all
        their inspirations. Lovely rivers, old mills and beautiful trees. That night after dinner we
        went to a nearby chateau, Azay-le-Rideau which was illuminated. Just like fairyland. They
        also had a sort of play very cleverly done just done with voices and lighting which told the
        history of the building. We will never forget it. Thursday, the Davidsons, our hosts and
        their little boy and ourselves went on another chateaux trip which was just a grand as the
        day before. We had a picnic on the way and tea on the way home. Great fun. The only thing
        that marred the trip was another guest who arrived who knew all about everything and told it
        in the loudest of voices. I got in a ter-rible row with him about sports. Everyone was on my
        side but you couldn't get a word in edge wise. It was was rather funny to look back on but I
        nearly had a nervous breakdown when it was going on. Friday we left Tours at about eleven
        and got back in Paris for lunch. After the lovely meal we charged out on foot to do some
        shopping. </p></letter>
