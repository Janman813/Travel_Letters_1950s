        We got on board about <time>10</time>
    <persName>Harriet</persName> had stayed in <placeName>Greenwich</placeName> over night so went in town with us. Wm drove the station wagon with our 
    bags. Very cleverlym selected as we had two <uDots>suut</uDots> cases each and a "bottle bag and the typewriter-plus
    a very unhealthy looking green duffle bag(reserved for purchases. THIS folded up on thebbottem of a suit case for future use!
        State room gay with flowers and champagne. We had a send of party. <persName>Billy</persName> was hiding behind a curtain and was a HUGE
    surprise'Caryl had arranged it this way Gail's mother and a friend- <persName>Dale</persName> and <persName>Kissy</persName> got to the dock just after <time>10.30 </time>
    and were not allowed to come on board. Too bad.
        Huge ship. Like a section of the Waldorf- the Reacock Alley plus several of the dining rooms- afloat Streams of 
    PEOPLE nulling about.
        We had a table in the dining room with 5 other femal ladies. Thought it would divert us. The one man looked us over and
        next meal he wasn't there. So we dr4ew ano another lady. It all proved to be amusing. We exchange addresses and werephotographed
        to-gether. 
    Voyage very smooth all way over. We took in the movies and pools. I won a few dollars on a pool.
        A Mr and Mrs Andeson, very nice friends of H. and <persName>Caryls </persName>asked us for cocktails one evening. Then there
        were the parties of the Captain and the Purser Also Esther Boyer was on board with a party of eight in cabin class, she 
        was to steer (ab??) over <placeName>Europe</placeName>. She came up and has tea with us one day.
        The Captain and Purser both were on the Franconia about years ago- as under officers- on a world cruise wer were on.
        Both exptremely cordial. 
        Took train around <time>noon</time> for <placeName>Paris</placeName>. Hot as blazes. and stuffy besides. Had lunch en route. Quite good.
        <placeName>Paris </placeName>and piled our belongings intoo a cab and landed at Le Br istol- a rather smallish hotel were diplomats go- white marble 
        and mirrors. We had an oval white panelled round sitting room. (which we didn't need and later gave up.)
        Very weary and after some refreshing tub baths went over to the Crenailliere(nearby) where we had a very delicious dinner.</p>
