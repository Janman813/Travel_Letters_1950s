                fields with many herds of deer roaming about </p>
            <p n="2"> In the evening we were invited to Mr Dessau's f or dinner. his son William
                came in to get us. Very nice and friendly. Almost everyone seems to speak English.
                They get a terrific lot of it in the schools. Mrs Dessau looks very young Had
                another son there-ROul- and his very sweet bride of a few months. She was born in
                Mexico and in fact IS Mexican but lived a long time in Texas. Does notnSpeak Danish.
                After meeting them all Mr Dessau Asked us to see his garden. He had several hundred
                parakets in a huge cage- like a b<rewrite tool="pen" wrote="ig">ig</rewrite>
                <underline>room</underline>- and arranged so they could fly in and out. Then he
                showed us his special pets Two tame Kangaroo!! They hoppedout of their enclosure and
                like to me patted. Very tam. He has had them several years. T gave Mrs Dessau one of
                my little trimmed Christmas trees And to the bride a little "shelf" which was really
                Mexican and I had trimmed it over and remade it They werre very pleqsed. had a nice
                evening and enjoyed them all. Also we LIKE the Toborg beer better than ant other
                kind!! </p>
