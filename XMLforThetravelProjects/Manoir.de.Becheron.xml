  <letter> 
      <p n="1">The Manoir de Bécheron is a private home which welcomes a few paying guests. It is a rambling <timePeriod>15th-16th Century</timePeriod> house 
   situated in the peaceful valley of the Indre in the heart of the Chateaux de la Loire region. The air of Old World charm
   with modern comfort. The cuisine is French, meals are 'en famille', except for breakfast, which is served in your room 
   or if you choose, in the gardens.
   You are one of us when we go visiting our French and American neighbors. Among them are such famous artists as <persName>Alexander 
   Calder</persName>, <persName>Max Ernst</persName> and <persName>A. Ozenfant.</persName>
   Bécheron is <measure>25 kilometers</measure> from Tours, which can be reached by rail from <placeName>Paris</placeName> in about two and half hours. Of course we
   meet you at the station.
   The rate in high-season <date>(June 15</date>-<date>August 31</date>) is <money>$15</money> a day or <money>$100</money> a week per person all inclusive (room, bath, 3 meals, 
   wines, liqueurs, coffee and service). This includes the local excursions around Bécheron such as Saché, Azay-le-Rideau,
   Tours, Langeais. The Saché Museum now houses a permanent exhibit of the sculpture of my father, <persName>Jo Davidson.</persName> The off-season
   rate <date>(March 1</date>-<date>June 14</date>; <date>Sept. 1</date>-<date>October 31)</date> is $10 a day or $65 a week per person. Contrary to the usual continental practice
   there are no extra charges at Bécheron.
   My French wife and I have two children,<persName> Eva</persName> age 12 and <persName>Laurent</persName> who is 5; we can and do care for children, and you will find 
   they are never underfoot. If you should want a place where you can safetly leave yours while touring <placeName>Europe, Bécheron</placeName> is 
   the place you are looking for. Our children were born in the <placeName>United States</placeName> and speak French and English as of course we do.
   A week in <placeName>Bécheron</placeName> is over before you realize it! You won't want to miss the thrilling sight of the illuminated chateaux;
   they alone are worth the trip. The "Sleeping Beauty" castle of Usse, Azay-le-Rideau, famous Chenonceau and Chambord are but 
   a few of the fabulous palaces which surround us.
   During one of your outings we will picnic in the Forêt de Loches near a circular <timePeriod>12th Century</timePeriod> chapel, or on the banks of the
   Loire across from Mme. de Pompadour's palace at Ménars. We will also take you to one of the outstanding restaurants of Tours 
   on a picturesque medieval square.
   We are looking forward with pleasure to meeting you, with or without your children. We'll be glad to answer any specific questions
   you may have. 
   Write for us. </p>
